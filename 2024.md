*Version 0.1; 12 November 2023*

**NeuCLIR has been accepted at TREC for a 3rd year!** While we get this website ready for 2024, please see the [2023 website](/2023) for information about the 2023 track. The 2024 track will be very similar to the 2023 track, with the following changes:

- The technical documents pilot has been promoted to a full task.
- Expansion of assessors for the technical documents track to several universities.
- Later submission deadlines.
- Support for the future translation of topics into languages other than the current track languages.
- A pilot of a query-driven report generation task (Generative IR) from the multilingual document set.
